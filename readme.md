# Node.js Random Color Generator

This application returns a random color in the command line.

It works like this:

When somebody enters a specific command in the command line, a block of approximately 31x9 `#` characters and of a random color (using hex code, e.g. `#ff0000`) is generated.

It looks pretty close to this:

It is able to not only accept the command itself, but also the request for a:

- hue (e.g. green or red or blue)
- luminosity (e.g. light or dark)

...and then generates random colors that match those choices.

**For example:**
